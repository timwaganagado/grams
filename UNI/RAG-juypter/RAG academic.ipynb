Having written your conclusion(s) it should be relatively straightforward to identify some recommendations.

A framework that describes different levels of thinking can be helpful to start to understand the concept of critical thinking. Blooms Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (1956) is one of the best -known of these (see Figure 9). ‘Creating’, ‘evaluating’ and ‘analysing’ are categorised here as being higher-order skills. Bloom’s Taxonomy Produce new or original work Design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate Justify a stand or decision Appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh Draw connections among ideas Differentiate, organise, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test Use information in new situations Execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch Explain ideas or concepts Classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognise, report, select, translate Recall facts and basic concepts Define, duplicate, list, memorise, repeat, state Figure 9: Bloom’s taxonomy (Sjolander, 2019) 62 ACADEMIC WRITING HANDBOOK FOR LEARNERS IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING (FET) SECTOR Here is a selection of phrases that may be helpful in demonstrating your ability to write critically in your academic work: Previous studies in this area have not dealt with… These results were based upon data from over 30 years ago and\n",
      "core of your discussion is a relatively detailed answer to your RQ. While all of your conclusions must rest on your literature-based analysis, the discussion is where it is most appropriate to share your own thoughts. Combining your findings and drawing meaningful conclusions, naturally means evaluating the importance of findings relative to others. As long as they are written in an objective manner, here is where you lay out which insights you deem most relevant. Another important aspect of a good discussion chapter is the evaluation of the limitations of your analysis. ReflectonwhichrelevantaspectsoftheRQyouranalysisisnotabletoanswerandhowtheseaspectsmight be address in future research. Note also that while you should add new thoughts and conclusions to your analysis in this chapter, the factual information should have been discussed in the previous chapters. As for the conclusion chapter, this chapter should not add new evidence. 8.7 Conclusion Thefinalchapterofyourthesisiswhereallaspectsofyourthesiscometogetherintheirmostreducedform. Whileitwillseemlikeeverythinghasbeensaidalready,theconclusionisoneofthemostimportantchapters of your thesis. Luckily, the conclusion comes with a very well-established structure: Introduction Your conclusion chapter starts with a small reintroduction of your topic. It is not uncommon to have one or two sentences copy and pasted from the introduction chapter. You should state your research topic and your subject of analysis. Research question State your RQ again. In the same words as you did in the introduction! Research design Quickly reintroduce your study area (country, years, etc.) and your research design (e.g., the model you use or the aspects you consider). Mini summary of findings Give a brief summary of your most important findings. 19 Answer your research question Thisisthemostimportantpart. TheanswertoyourRQisyourinterpretationofthefindingsandconclusions. It should be relatively brief and very precise. The phrasing of your answer will show the examiner whether or not you have understood the scope and limitations of your findings. It is a balancing act to phrase a strong, relevant and catchy answer to your RQ while being clear about the limited validity of your findings. To give you an example: A bad phrasing: “Based on the previous analysis, it has become clear that manufacturing and finance are engines of growth in India. (...) The finance sector might be good too, but it is much worse that the communication and business sectors are definitely not.” A good phrasing: “The previous analysis suggests that under limited conditions manufacturing and finance are engines of growth in India. (...) Though I find the finance sector likely to be an engine of growth, it seems more worrying that the communication and business sectors are not.” The answer to your RQ typically includes coming back to the policy relevance of the problem considered and highlight the policy conclusions to be drawn from your findings / answer. This could be, for example, a policy recommendation, a word of caution for researchers or a prediction for the future. Limitations and future research Last but not least, you will need to point out again the most important limitations of your thesis and which possible improvement should potentially be made in the future. Additionally, you may provide the reader with potential future RQs and ideas\n",

      "One of the strongest arguments for Martian life is the planet’s history of water. Satellite\n",
      "imagery and rover missions have revealed dried-up riverbeds, minerals that form in liquid\n",
      "water, and polar ice caps. Recent findings of seasonal methane spikes in the Martian\n",

      "activity. Although geological processes could explain these emissions, they leave open the\n",

      "Mars also shares important conditions with Earth that could support life, at least in a primitive\n",

      "high acidity suggest that life is remarkably adaptable and could potentially exist beneath\n",
      "Mars’s surface, shielded from harmful solar radiation.\n",
      "However, significant challenges remain. The Martian surface is exposed to high levels of\n",
      "cosmic radiation, and the thin atmosphere provides little protection or warmth. Water in liquid\n",

      "of biology and the universe. It would raise new questions: Did life on Earth and Mars share a\n",

      "Current and future missions, such as NASA’s Perseverance rover and the European Space\n",

      "\n",
      "The Potential of Life on Mars is an engaging and well-structured essay that effectively explores the possibility of life existing on Mars. The author presents a clear argument, supported by relevant scientific evidence, and demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clear structure**: The essay follows a logical structure, with each paragraph building upon the previous one to create a cohesive narrative.\n",
      "2. **Effective use of evidence**: The author skillfully incorporates scientific findings, such as seasonal methane emissions and extremophiles on Earth, to support their argument.\n",
      "3. **Good transitions**: The essay flows smoothly between paragraphs, thanks to effective transition phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Conclude more strongly**: While the conclusion is clear, it could be strengthened by summarizing the main points and reiterating the significance of finding life on Mars.\n",
      "2. **Use more nuanced language**: Some sentences are a bit straightforward; consider using more descriptive language to enhance the reader's engagement.\n",
      "3. **Consider adding more depth**: While the essay provides a solid overview, it might benefit from exploring specific aspects in greater detail, such as the implications of finding life on Mars or the challenges faced by potential Martian organisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Feedback:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The introduction could be stronger; instead of simply stating that Mars has captured human imagination, consider highlighting the significance of discovering life beyond Earth.\n",
      "2. In the paragraph discussing the Martian environment, you could expand on how these conditions might affect the likelihood of finding life.\n",
      "3. In the conclusion, rephrase the sentence \"Whether Mars harbors remnants of past organisms or even living microbes today...\" to make it more concise and impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use academic tone**: While the essay is well-written, some sentences could be rephrased in a more formal, academic tone.\n",
      "2. **Cite sources**: To strengthen your arguments, consider incorporating specific citations from scientific papers or studies.\n",
      "3. **Edit for clarity and concision**: Review your essay to ensure that each sentence contributes to the overall narrative and avoid unnecessary words or phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing these suggestions and refining your writing style, you can further enhance The Potential of Life on Mars and produce a compelling essay that effectively argues for the possibility of life existing on Mars.\n"
